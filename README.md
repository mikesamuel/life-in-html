# Game of Life in HTML

This is just a simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life] in
an HTML page.

My son and I implemented it together.  It's not meant to be useful for
anything.

You can use it at [mikesamuel.github.io/life-in-html/](https://mikesamuel.github.io/life-in-html/).

There's a color picker at top, a pause/resume
button that controls the simulation,
and just click in the grid to toggle a cell.
